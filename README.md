** flex-Android-Material-Skins **

Set of Skins for Flex Mobile. 

So far I skinned

- Actionbar (no animation needed)
- Buttonbar (animations added)
- Callout
- Toggle Switch (animations added)
- Raised Button (animations added)
- Flat Button (animations added)
- Circle Button 
- List (animations added)
- HSlider (animations added)
- HScrollBar
- Checkbox (using FXG for now) 
- Radiobutton (animationd added) 
- Textinput 
- Textarea 
- TransparentActionButton (ripple animation added) 
- TransparentNavigationButton(ripple animation added) 
- VScrollBar

I am using all actionscript, so component colors can be configured in CSS. 

If anyone would like to contribute, create a pull request, or if you want a component skinned open an issue

animations are being added in based on https://github.com/rui-cruz/Spark-Material collaboration will take place 
to merge the 2 repositories for a complete set of desktop and mobile skins. Great inkRipple Class Rui!!!!
